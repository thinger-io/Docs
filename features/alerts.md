# ALERTS

What are alerts used for?

Alerts in Thinger.io serve several important purposes:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: They allow users to monitor their devices in real-time and receive immediate notifications about critical events, such as device failures or abnormal conditions.
2. **Predictive Maintenance**: They help anticipate problems before they occur, which is essential for predictive maintenance. For example, receiving an alert when a motor's temperature exceeds a specific threshold can prevent major failures.
3. **Security and Control**: They enhance security by alerting users about unauthorized access or suspicious activities. Alerts can also be used for control, activating other devices or services in response to an event.
4. **Operational Optimization**: They facilitate operational optimization by providing information on device performance, allowing for continuous adjustments and improvements in processes.
5. **Customized Notifications**: Users can define custom alerts according to their specific needs, ensuring that relevant information is delivered to the right people at the right time.

## Alerts Console&#x20;

To access the alert functionality, click on the "alerts" tab in the main menu. This will take you to the alerts terminal, where you can view all currently active alert events. This interface provides useful information related to each alert, including the time the alert was triggered, the severity, and the current status of the alert. You can also see details about the affected device and any relevant data points that caused the alert to be triggered.&#x20;

This comprehensive overview allows you to monitor the status of your devices in real-time and respond promptly to any issues. But if more detail is required, there is also an "alerts Inspector" accessible using the top-right corner menu, which allows to review of the raw data of the server events that are being produced by each Alerts rule.&#x20;

## **Creating new alerts**

Alerts are generated by the server when the criteria specified in a rule are met. Users can define these alerts by accessing the "Rules" section of the alerts console. In this section, you will find a list of existing rules, which allows for their management, as well as the option to create new rules by clicking the "+ Add Rule" button, which will display the following context:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Rule information

* Rule Identifier: A unique identifier without spaces and special characters must be used&#x20;
* Name: Mnemonic identification for users&#x20;
* Description: Additional information to help recognize the rule in the long term

#### Configuration

* **Enabled**: Allows to enable or disable the execution of the rule
* **Severity**: This is used to categorize and prioritize alerts based on their importance or impact. It helps users manage and respond to different types of events more effectively.&#x20;
* **Check interval:** Is used to define how frequently the system evaluates the conditions set in a rule to determine if an alert should be triggered. It allows users to adjust the check interval based on the specific needs of their monitoring setup.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that setting an appropriate check interval helps balance the frequency of evaluations with system resource usage. In scenarios requiring high responsiveness, a shorter interval may be chosen, while less critical scenarios may use a longer interval. If the interval is too long, critical issues might not be detected promptly, while a very short interval may lead to excessive checks and potential performance impacts.
{% endhint %}

## Rule definition

Este submenú permite especificar el comportamiento de la regla, especificando qué variables se van a  monitorizar, cual es el valor de consigna y qué resultado tendrá  cuando se produzcan evaluaciones positivas de la condición. También se especifica el comportamiento de desactivación de la regla

### Data sources

This section allows users to specify which data sources will be evaluated by the rule. Data sources may include data from buckets, device properties, or the device status (allowing also to monitor device disconnections).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Name: Use a unique identifier avoiding spaces or special characters. This name will be used to identify the JSON which contains the data point.&#x20;
* Data source: This may be a Devie Property, a Data Bucket, or the Device Status. Note that depending on the data source type, the menu may expose filtering options that allows to work with multiple devices with the same behavior, so just one rule can be used to monitor multiple devices.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
When working with device data, it is recommended to use a product data bucket instead of individual data buckets. This way just one rule will monitor every product devices.
{% endhint %}

#### Multiple data sources

In the "Data Sources" section of the rule configuration menu in Thinger.io, the **"+ Add Source"** button allows users to add variables to a specific rule. This feature is essential for configuring the rule with the necessary data for evaluation.&#x20;

### Activation

The alert activation refers to the process in which the system monitors the variables specified in the "Sources" section and generates notifications when these conditions are met. This means the system continuously checks the data against the defined criteria to detect any deviations or specific events but note that it is possible to define confirmation criteria that prevent false activations.

The alert activation section in Thinger.io consists of a form with three main sections: **Conditions**, **Confirmation**, and **Notification**. Each of these sections plays a crucial role in defining how and when alerts are triggered and how notifications are managed.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Conditions**: allows users to define one or more comparisons of a selected variable and a setpoint. These conditions specify the exact criteria that must be met for the alert to be activated. By setting these conditions, users can precisely monitor the desired metrics and ensure alerts are only triggered when specific thresholds or ranges are met. The comparisons can be:
  * Greater than
  * Less than
  * Equal to
  * Not equal to
  * Within a range
  * Outside of a range

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that it is possible to create more complex behaviors by adding additional conditions to the rule
{% endhint %}

* **Confirmation**: This section section helps to avoid false activations of alerts. it is an essential step for filtering out transient or spurious events that do not require immediate attention, thus ensuring that alerts are only generated for sustained or repeated conditions. This can be configured in several ways:
  * Immediate Confirmation: The alert is triggered as soon as the condition is met.
  * Sequence: The alert is activated if the condition is met multiple times&#x20;
  * Timespan: The alert is only triggered if the condition remains true for a specified amount of consecutive valid comparisons.
* **Notification**: This section allows users to define the endpoint profile (previously defined) that will be used to send the notification if the alert is necessary. By configuring the notification settings, users can ensure that the right people are informed promptly about critical conditions, facilitating a quick and appropriate response.&#x20;

### Normalization

The normalization section of the rules configuration allows users to define the platform's behavior for deactivating an alert when the necessary conditions for it to be cleared are met in the device's data. This configuration uses the same elements as in the activation section, but with the focus on setting values that ensure a reliable deactivation of the alert.

### Reminders

The **Reminder** section of the alerts configruation is designed to provide ongoing notifications at regular intervals when an alert remains active. This feature ensures that critical alerts are not overlooked or forgotten over time. It is possible to select two elements:&#x20;

* Interval: Users can specify the time interval at which the reminders should be sent. This can be configured to match the urgency of the alert, with shorter intervals for more critical issues and longer intervals for less urgent ones.
* Notification:  Users can define the endpoint profile for the reminder notifications. This includes the communication method (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) and the details for delivering these reminders.

## Alerts list

The **Alerts List** in Thinger.io is a comprehensive interface that displays all the active alarms generated by the system when the specified conditions are met. It provides a detailed overview of all current alarms that have been triggered. This list helps users to track and manage ongoing issues across their IoT devices and systems.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Key Data Displayed in the Alerts List**

* **Alarm ID:** Each alarm is assigned a unique ID for easy reference and tracking.
* **Origin:** It's the source of the alarm, it indicates the device or data source that triggered the alarm. This helps in identifying the exact point of origin for the alert.
* **Severity:** Displays the severity of the alarm, as it was defined in the rule confiuration. This feature is aimed to help to prioritize response actions. Severity levels might include _Critical, High, Medium, Low_ and _None._
* **State:** The status of the Alarm, it shows the current state of the alarm, which can be:
  * **Activated:** The alarm is currently active and has not been resolved.
  * **Latch:** The alarm has been acknowledged but remains active.
  * **Shelve:** The alarm has been temporarily suppressed or postponed.
* **Values:** Displays the trigger Variable, the specific variable that triggered the alarm along with its current value, Helping to understanding the cause of the alarm.

1. **Visualized Time**
   * **Timestamp:** Indicates the moment when the alarm was first viewed by the user. This helps in tracking how long the alarm has been known to the team.
2. **Elapsed Time**
   * **Duration:** Shows the time elapsed since the alarm was activated. This information is critical for measuring response times and understanding the persistence of issues.

### Alerts management&#x20;

The **Alerts List** also includes several control functions that appear when one or more alarm instances are selected. These controls allow users to manage the alarms effectively.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Alarm management in the Alerts List is a critical function that allows users to maintain control over active alarms, ensuring that they are addressed appropriately and efficiently. Here’s how each control contributes to effective alarm management:

* **Acknowledge:** When users acknowledge an alarm, it signifies that the alert has been noticed and is being addressed. This step is essential in a team environment to prevent multiple people from working on the same issue unknowingly.
* **Shelve:** Shelving an alarm allows users to temporarily suppress it, reducing noise and distraction from alerts that are known but not immediately actionable. This helps in focusing on more urgent alarms while ensuring that less critical ones are revisited later.
* **Latch:** Latching an alarm ensures that it stays active until a manual action is taken to clear it. This is particularly useful for severe issues that require explicit confirmation that they have been resolved, ensuring accountability and thoroughness in alarm management.
* **Clear:** Clearing an alarm is the final step once the issue has been resolved. This keeps the Alerts List up to date and focused only on current, unresolved issues, helping users to quickly identify and respond to ongoing problems.
* **Set Projects:** Assigning alarms to projects helps in organizing and managing them within specific contexts. This is particularly useful in larger deployments where alarms may pertain to different devices, locations, or operational areas.
* **Remove:** Removing alarms from the system is necessary for cleaning up outdated or irrelevant alarms. This ensures that the Alerts List remains relevant and uncluttered, making it easier to manage current alarms.
