# License Setting

Any management related to the subscription of a Thinger.io license will be carried out through the customer portal, available at the following link:

{% endhint %}

To access the portal, obtain a one-time key, which will be sent to the email address entered in the portal. The server administration email address provided during the subscription should be used.
