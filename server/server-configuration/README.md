# SERVER ADMINISTRATION

The **SERVER ADMINISTRATION** section serves as the central control panel for managing the core operations and configurations of the Thinger.io server instance. This comprehensive area provides administrators with essential tools to maintain, monitor, and troubleshoot the server environment effectively.

Within this section, detailed options are available for **License Setting**, to manage a server's licensing; **Server Settings**, for configuring critical operational parameters; **Cluster / Server Status**, to monitor the health and performance of a server or cluster; and **Server Logs**, for reviewing system activity and error records.
