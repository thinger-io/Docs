# SERVER DEPLOYMENT

Freemium accounts are perfect for learning and testing the Thinger.io platform with only a few limitations. However, for getting the best performance and reliability of this platform and access to some advanced features that are essential for professional use, it is necessary to deploy a private Thinger.io Server.&#x20;

## Private Instance Benefits

Thinger.io supports private cloud deployments that can be automatically launched from the pricing page. Private instances are isolated servers for each customer, so the instance is not shared with thousands of other users from our community.&#x20;

The next list details every Thinger.io Private instance's advantages:&#x20;

* 100% **Private Server** hosted in the cloud or on-premise.
* **Unlimited** sampling intervals
* **Plugins** System Deployment with different extensions available.&#x20;
* **File Storage System** that allows saving context data or any kind of files
* **Multiple User Support** allows creating and managing individual customer accounts on the server. &#x20;
* **Multi-Tenancy Support** with multiple web-console rebranding profiles and web domains hosted by just one server instance. &#x20;
* Support for real-time **data aggregation**

## Hosting options

Private instances can be deployed within minutes over the main cloud provider hosts, but also in an On-premise server:

{% content-ref url="thinger.io-cloud-server.md" %}
[thinger.io-cloud-server.md](thinger.io-cloud-server.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="on-premise.md" %}
[on-premise.md](on-premise.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Managing subscription

The administrator of a private instance of Thinger.io can edit the preferences of the subscription using the management portal. For this, access the website [**https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/00g9D1fN50SIcpOfYY**](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/00g9D1fN50SIcpOfYY)**,** a One Time Password will be obtained and sent to the associated email address upon execution of the request.
