# CHANGELOG

## 6.1.0

**Community Release Date:**  08-04-2024.

**Private Servers Release Date:**  15-04-2024.

#### Added

* Brand PWA configuration includes support for uploading app icons directly from the filesystem. It also allow the configuration of both 'maskable' and 'any' icon purposes. Fixes [https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/84](https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/84)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (617).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>PWA Images can be uploaded from filesystem</p></figcaption></figure>

* Brand Share Image includes support for uploading an image directly from the filesystem.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (618).png" alt="" width="374"><figcaption><p>Share Image can be uploaded from filesystem</p></figcaption></figure>

* Brand Logos are now served from web server instead of a JSON config, which should reduce load time.
* Brand PWA "start\_url" to make the console installable on Chrome.
* Products can now be configured to resend device data to a given endpoint. For example, fetch a given resource every n seconds, or take data from a topic, and resend it to another service.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (619).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Endpoint configuration fon product profile.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Products can now configure bucket tags to be used on the automatic initialization. Fixes [https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/81](https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/81)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (620).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Data tags configuration on the Product bucket.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Products can now handle Resource Streams, i.e., to create custom profiles for HTTP devices.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (621).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>New Device Stream target on Product API Resources.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Endpoint call event now provides context about the caller.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (622).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Endpoint call caller context</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Improved

* Add some resources cache for a better performance on massive endpoint calls and bucket writes.
* HTTP devices has been migrated to a new connection schema where it is possible to log their statistics, like bytes sent, received, and connections, as any other MQTT or IOTMP device.
* HTTP devices can be used now used inside dashboards with resources defined at product level.
* Device property selector for HTML widgets allow selecting any parent node (with nested values), or all property values by not selecting any field. Fixes [https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/16](https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/16)
* Property PATCH now supports regular JSON for partial property updates. Fixes [https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/16](https://github.com/thinger-io/thinger-server/issues/16)
* Brand icons and logos are now served from filesystem instead of data url, improving page load.
* Dashboard HTML widgets from external storage now longer requires public storage access. In case of members of a project, they will require read access to the storage.
* Product properties, topics, resources, and functions can be generated now by calling a product function.&#x20;
* Product bucket writes can now override tags values based on the write payload. Previously, tags like device were always being set by the product, discarding any "device" field present on the payload.
* Compatibility with OpenSSL 3.0 on SSL certificate provisioning.
* IP Geocoding automatic updates.

#### Fixed

* Apex Charts widget colors not honoring time series color configuration.
* Binary data on a product payload not processed correctly.
* Visual Studio Code not opening the file storage correctly.

* Info page display on empty or restricted resources.
* Statistics on sockets count.

## 6.0.0

**Release Date:** 11-03-2024

#### **Added**

* **Property Forms üìù** : Allow creating custom forms for improving the user experience when setting values inside a property, i.e., when configuring a device. The form can be defined at Product level, and it is currently supported by [Formly](https://formly.dev/).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (586).png" alt="" width="457"><figcaption><p>Property Forms</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (587).png" alt="" width="398"><figcaption><p>Device property editor using a form</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Property Location** üìç: Location properties now display a map for picking the address directly from the map or via a search bar for using an address. Once an address is selected, it automatially fills the coordinates and timezone.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (588).png" alt="" width="398"><figcaption><p>Property location editor</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (591).png" alt="" width="396"><figcaption><p>Property raw fields generated by location editor.</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Dashboard Functions** ‚ö°: Dashboard now supports creating custom functions for processing any data used in dashboard, i.e., for changing units, cropping decimals, or filtering values. Conversion functions can be selected on the data source configuration.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (593).png" alt="" width="454"><figcaption><p>Dashboard Functions.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (594).png" alt="" width="456"><figcaption><p>Source processing using Dashboard Function.</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Dashboard Placeholders** üè∑: Dashboard now supports settings placeholders from a fixed value, or a device property. Placeholders can be used in a any string field on the dashboard, i.e., titles, units, or even inside functions to change the functions behaviour depending on current device configuration.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (597).png" alt="" width="455"><figcaption><p>Dashboard Placeholders.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (598).png" alt="" width="455"><figcaption><p>Dashboard Placeholder used inside a Unit Field.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (599).png" alt="" width="454"><figcaption><p>Dashboard Placeholder used inside Dashboard Function.</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Dashboard Property Button** üÜï : New "Property Button" widget for opening device properties for its modification, even if they have a Property Form defined.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (600).png" alt="" width="458"><figcaption><p>Property Button Configuration.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (602).png" alt="" width="177"><figcaption><p>Property Button on Dashboard.</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Dashboard Group Widget (BETA)** üî† : New Group Widget that brings the possibility to add any number of widgets inside a parent widget.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (603).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Group Widget</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Dashboard Property Table (BETA) üî†** : Introducing a new widget that enables quick editing of properties for a device or a set of devices. This widget includes various built-in controls such as text display, input text, input number, slider, color selection, switch, a save button, and an edit button. These elements can be configured in each column to patch a single property value.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (605).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Property Table</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (604).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Property Table Configuration</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Claiming Feature**‚òùÔ∏è: The Claiming Feature is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed for administrators to configure and expose a selected number of resources, such as devices, for end-user claiming. This feature enables administrators to effortlessly set up various resources which end-users can subsequently request. Upon a successful request, these resources, like specific devices, are automatically integrated into the end-users' accounts. This streamlined process not only enhances user experience by simplifying resource acquisition but also provides administrators with efficient control over resource distribution and management.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (606).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Claim Configuration</p></figcaption></figure>

One of the key strengths of this feature is its flexibility in claiming methods: users can initiate a claim through a directly generated URL, by scanning a QR Code, or by using a specific Claim Code:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (607).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Claim Details</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (608).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Claim Process - Initial Step</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (609).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Claim Process - Review</p></figcaption></figure>

Once claim is completed, the process may request the configuration of the devices, i.e., via the Property Forms defined on the product.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (610).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Claim Process - Complete &#x26; Configure</p></figcaption></figure>

*   **Configurable Brand Accounts**üë®‚Äçüíº: We've introduced a new "Accounts" section for each brand. This enhancement allows more control over brand-specific behaviors, including:

    * **Cross Sign-In Control:** Decide whether users registered with one brand can log in to another, enhancing security and user management.
    * **Public Sign-Up Options:** Choose whether to allow public sign-up for each brand, providing flexibility in user onboarding.
    * **Automated Role Assignment:** Set specific account roles for users who register through public sign-up, such as automatically assigning 'member' status for device claiming purposes.

    This update offers more customization to better align with your brand's unique operational needs.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (611).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Brands Accounts Configuration</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Configurable Brand Scripts** üñ•Ô∏è : We've rolled out an exciting update: you can now configure custom scripts for your brand's index.html. This enhancement is perfect for integrating tools like Google Tag Manager and monitor your customers traffic.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (613).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Brand Scripts Configuration</p></figcaption></figure>

* **New Permissions** üîí: Console is introducing an array of specific new permissions, enhancing the granularity with which administrators can control member access and actions within the console. This update distinctly separates permissions for actions performed through the API from those executed directly on the console interface. In the current version, all existing permissions will continue to function as before. However, future updates will require the explicit assignment of 'View' permissions to maintain the access level. This change lays the groundwork for more precise and customizable user role management, ensuring enhanced security and efficiency in operation. At this moment they are partially released for Devices, but will be covering the whole console in future updates.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (615).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>New View</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Updated Editors** :woman\_technologist:: Now editors are based on Monaco (the editor from Visual Studio Code) with support to maximize the editor and copy the contents:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (614).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>New Code/Value editor in the console.</p></figcaption></figure>

* **New Icon Picker** :unicorn: :  There is a new icon picker with much more variety of icon and improved search capabilities.
