# LINUX / RASPBERRY PI

This how-to will cover how to get the first steps while using the thinger.io platform in the Raspberry Pi or any other Linux device. This includes how to install dependencies, clone the source code, and compile and execute the main example available in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thinger-io/IOTMP-Linux).

## Requirements

* A Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, and a terminal or SSH access. Other OS like Ubuntu or Debian may work but have not been tested yet. This tutorial has been tested with Debian Buster version.
* Register a device in the thinger.io console and keep the credentials by hand. If any help is needed, please check this other [how-to](https://community.thinger.io/t/register-a-device-in-the-console/23).

## Install Dependencies

Thinger.io implementation for Linux requires some tools and libraries for its compilation:

* A C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
* CMake to guide the compilation and search for installed libraries
* OpenSSL for using secure connections with the platform
* Boost Libraries used for high-performance async input/output&#x20;

To install these dependencies, update the apt repository and install packages first.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Then, install the described packages:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc g++ cmake libssl-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev
```

## Compile Client

Download the latest Linux Client version from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinger-io/IOTMP-Linux.git
```

Enter the IOTMP-Linux folder we just cloned.

```bash
cd IOTMP-Linux
```

Create a build folder and enter it:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run CMake

```bash
cmake ../
```

If everything goes fine, it should display something like:

```bash
pi@RevPi20679:~/thinger_iotmp_linux_client/build $ cmake ../

```

Then, run make to generate the binary.

```bash
make
```

&#x20;Take a coffee now ☕️. It can take some minutes to complete.

## Run Client

After it compiles, it is possible to execute the binary by providing the username, device, and credentials parameters.

```bash
pi@RevPi20679:~/thinger_iotmp_linux_client/build $ ./thinger -u username -d device -p credential --host "perf.aws.thinger.io"
