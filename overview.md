# OVERVIEW

This documentation is related to connecting Arduino-compatible devices to Thinger.io. In Thinger.io, it is possible to connect almost any Arduino board using Ethernet, WiFi, GSM, or even hardware from different vendors that are compatible with the Arduino ecosystem, like ESP8266, ESP32, and TI CC3200.

Thinger.io provides a library for such devices, simplifying the cloud connectivity, i.e., handling the network connection, managing reconnection to the cloud, and exposing resources from a device, like a sensor or actuator. This library is specifically designed for the Arduino IDE ecosystem, but it is also possible to use Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO. With this library, devices can be easily programmed and connected within minutes. Once the device is connected, it is possible to create dashboards, store device information in data buckets, or send its data to external services.
