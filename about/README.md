# ABOUT

## History

The Thinger.io Platform project began in early 2015, with its initial source code lines written in 2014. It originated as a side-project by Dr. Álvaro Luis Bustamante while he was a researcher at the University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain). After studying various solutions for online interaction with affordable electronic devices, he found existing platforms to be either difficult to use, inefficient, or lacking sufficient capabilities to simply create professional IoT projects.

> _"Why I have to select a compatible vendor hardware? Why I need to use an Operating System just for my toaster? Why my device must run a scripting language that burn the batteries? Why I have to rely on a specific vendor and its closed platform? These are some questions I made myself before starting to work in the thinger.io platform."_

What began as a backend project to retrieve data and control devices in real-time quickly became a much more general tool that could be easily extended in any direction. In 2018, the project was turned into a loyalty-founded company and released an enterprise version of the Thinger.io platform technology to provide professional support for IoT projects with the original vision of a perfect balance between simple but powerful technology.  &#x20;
