## Integrating TTN devices

When using our TTN or TTN Stack (v3) platform, it is possible to integrate LoRaWAN devices with Thinger.io using our [The Things Stack integration plugin](https://marketplace.thinger.io/plugins/ttn-stack/), which simplifies the connection of both platform and also provides some interesting features such as devices auto-provisioning, payload data processing and gateway data filtering.
