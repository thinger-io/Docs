# OVERVIEW

## What is Thinger.io?

Thinger.io is a cloud IoT Platform that provides every needed tool to prototype, scale and manage connected products in a very simple way. Our goal is to democratize the use of IoT making it accessible to the whole world, and streamlining the development of big IoT projects.

* **Free IoT platform**: Thinger.io provides a lifetime freemium account with only few limitations to start learning and prototyping when your product becomes ready to scale, you can deploy a Premium Server with full capacities within minutes.
* **Simple but Powerful**: Just a couple code lines to connect a device and start retrieving data or controlling its functionalities with our web-based Console, able to connect and manage thousands of devices in a simple way.
* **Hardware agnostic:** Any device from any manufacturer can be easily integrated with Thinger.io's infrastructure.
* **Extremely scalable & efficient infrastructure:** thanks to our unique communication paradigm, in which the IoT **server subscribes device resources** to retrieve data only when it is necessary, a single Thinger.io instance is able to manage thousands of IoT devices with low computational load, bandwidth and latencies.&#x20;
* **Open-Source**: most of the platform modules, libraries and APP source code are available in our Github repository to be downloaded and modified with MIT license.&#x20;
